    About Sophie
  </h1>
  <div class="underline"></div>
  <div> 
      <p class="intro">
        My name is Sophie, and I come from County Clare. I am 22 years old.
    I grew up in the countryside, have one brother and one sister. My parents ran a construction company. They were always very supportive with each of their us with regards what career path we wanted to take and offered us the best advice possible, which i can imagine being very difficult to get through to a hormonal 17 year "who knows it all"! I always had an interest in the hair industry. After finishing school, I had developed a poor relationship with books and decided i did not want to go on to study at University as I had lost all interest in studies due to disliking the subjects i had kept on for my Leaving Cert. I was going to do a business degree which i deffered for that year because I just wasnt ready. I then kept on the summer job I had, in a cafe in Ennis, which I was very fortunate that they still had full time work for me even after the summer season! It was then that I really decided I liked working with people and that I wanted to dip my toes in the hair industry!</p>
  </div>
  <h1 id="why-hair"> Why Hairdressing? </h1>
  <div class="underline"></div>
  <div>
  <p> There were a number of factors which led me into the hair industry, first and foremost I always had a passion for all things hair! 
    From a young age i enjoyed plazying with hair, be it giving my dollyheads a "haircut", or thinking i was some sort of colourist and home dying my hair all sorts of colours. i also always enjoyed styling hair, fortunately my younger sister had a fantastic head of hair which i used to love curling and "upstyling" Etc. 
    I also knew I wanted to work with people, I am very chatty and sociable as a person which I guess meets the criteria of becoming a good hairdresser because believe me you meet all sorts in the industry and need to be able to deal with everyone and everyone in a professional manner.
    I also have always been quite the creative, and one regret I actually had in school was dropping art for the leaving cert. The reason i chose to do so was because I loved it so much that I used to spend hours at my art homework and neglect other subjects. In hindsight now when i look back, i would have been better off putting them hours into art, besides staring at the wall in the study centre, avoiding the subjects I had kept on! But hey, hindsight is a great thing, and I reckon the world would be a boring place if we all knew excactly from a young age what we wanted to do or what our strong areas were.
    I was always strong at maths too, I dropped to ordinary for the Leaving Cert, as I felt i would also spend too much time trying to graft through higher level maths and again neglect the other subjects. Which again, looking back now, I enjoyed the problem solving side of things and my time would have been better spent doing this! So I guess I also realised I enjoyed solving problems which is a huge part of hairdressing, is solving peoples hair problems, and putting plans in place to ensure the client reaches the end goal. The main aim of the game, making each client feel amazing!</p>
    
    <h2> The hunt for an apprenticeship </h2>
    <p> Whilst I kept up my job in the cafe, I decided to start looking at various hairdressing colleges and apprenticeships.
    Having took a trip to Dublin, and spoke with leading hairdressing Colleges, ie. Dylan Bradshaw, Robert Chambers etc, I also applied for various apprenticeships in Dublins creative district, South William Street! I distinctly remember speaking with a member of management in award winning salon Zeba. he gave me the best advice i recieved all day, he said "pop  across the road to the PeterMark college/offices, drop your CV to HR, and get an apprenticeship with them".
    I did just that, upon entering that building that day, i was totally mesmorised by the sheek decor, the buzz and atmosphere of the place!
    I spoke with a lovely lady from HR, who asked me what my preferred salon would be, which I went on to explain I was happy to leave my hometown of Ennis, and was open to working in Galway, Limerick or Dublin.</p>
    <h2> Interviews and trial days </h2>
    <p>
      Following that, a few days later I recieved a phone call from an unrecognised number, which turned out to be PeterMark in the Corrib Shopping Centre Galway. I went through a series of interviews and a trial days, which i actually didnt get offered the position straight away.
    I was most definatley a small bit disheartened, but was determined not to give up. </p>
    <h2> Another glimmer of hope and sheer determination</h2>
   <p> I then spoke with some salon owners in Ennis, looking for an apprenticeship. A lovely lady, in a salon in Ennis in Ennis offered me one day a week work experience in the salon.
    I was delighted with this, and i used to go in on my day off from my cafe job.
    i really got a feel for salon life, and the girls working there at the time could not have been more helpful and encouraging.
    As the weeks went on the owner of this salon kindly offered me 2-3 days a week in the salon, I was more than happy with this offer, but as the saying goes....when it rains it pours!</p>

<h2> The beginning of a new adventure</h2>
<div>
    <p>
      Literally a day or two later, I recieved a call from PeterMark in the Corrib, bearing in mind I had rang them a few times since not getting the job to check if any position had come available! low and behold I was offered a full time apprenticeshhip in Galway. I gave my cafe job two weeks notice, and told the other salon that I had been offered full time and was going to go ahead with it as I felt it was the best option for me at the time.
    </p>
    <h2>moving to Galway</h2>
    <p>
      As you can imagine, moving to a new city, barely 18, and two weeks to find accomodation in an already over populated city, the month before Christmas, proved very difficult.
    I eventually found a room to rent in a house in the westside of the city, with 4 other girls who were all around my own age, whom i am still in ocntact with today! I luckily settled in very quickly and adjusted to life living in a city, trying to figure out buses etc, no Mam or Dad to be ferrying me from A to B anymore!
  </p>
  <h2>The begining was tough</h2>
  <p>
  I will never forget my first week on the salon floor! It was the last week in November, so the begining of the Christmas rush, meaning that there was no training classes being done until January. The salon was super busy, all of the staff were so so lovely and welcoming but because of volume of clients coming in our doors, i barely had the chance to have a proper conversation with any of them. I was the newest trainee and with little experience I spent the month cleaning, shampooing and making teas and coffees. I knew straight away that i loved the buzz of the salon etc, but my feet were killed! I never felt as lonely in my life, and I guess this was due to the fact of being in a new job, new city, all new people and no familiar faces which I guess dragged because of the festive time of year that it was. As much as I loved it, I was beyond happy to see my Father Christmas Eve to give me a lift home to Clare for the few days of festivities!</p>
  
  <h2>New Year and a much more confident trainee</h2>
  <p>
    I've always said it, but the time of the year I began my apprenticeship really stood to me, as I really did get a feel for the salon and was thrown in the deep end numerous times, doing jobs as simple as bringing end colours through, which was a big deal to me because I was still so green! My confidence deffinatly soared, and I was very excited to begin my training Classes every Wednesday.
  </p>
  <h2> Courses, Courses and more Courses!</h2>
  <p>
    As I ploughed on through my first year of my 4 year contract, I am proud to say that i had completed my Induction training, Colour 1, 2 and 3 just before Christmas, mind you there were some struggles along the way, I honestly never thought I'd be able to do a head of highlights from the get go!
    Again timing was on my side, whilst I was very confident to do a tint on the floor or take over a blowdry, I done my first few heads of highlights on the floor during the Christmas madness! </p>

   <p> Then throughout my 2nd year, I completed all of my cutting courses, mind you despite having completed and passed them all 1st time, I still felt like i knew nothing! </p>

   <p> In February of 2018 i completed my Gents cutting course, which was the last step before the much anticipated but also feared, Creative edge- a then 8 week course in Dublin which basically married all the skills I had then learned together, by doing 2 models a day our wonderful trainer really turned us all into little stylists with a whole new confidence. which I was thrilled to pass!
  </p>

    <p> I then went straight on to do my Graduation, which was 6 weeks. I done my Creative Edge and Graduation back to back meaning I had spent 14 weeks up and down to Dublin between college and work on the Saturday on the salon floor in Galway. This was one of the biggest challenges, due to a combination of things. I was stressed out for the obvious reason of the intensity of these two courses one after another, and not being from Dublin proved difficult to organise models for exams....but I got there in the end! It was also very financially draining as a 3rd year apprentice at the time, the money was not great, and trying to pay rent and bills in Galway with a hotel in Dublin snd the expense of eating out all the time proved very difficult! I was very fortunate to hsve such supportive parents who helped cover the cost of the hotel! Another element of stress at this point, was that we had a new manager in salon, who I did not see eye to eye with and unfortunatly she gave me a hard time the days I was in salon, and having internalised on this in recent years, I will admit I had a hot head, and I guess that is something i learned to control over the years. Anyhow, I graduated and was so thrilled to recieve my graduation scissors, leave Dublin and get on the floor as a fully qualified stylist! </p>

    <h2>Life as a new Stylist</h2>
    <p>
      I was so proud to have got to where I was, even tho I was technically fully qualified, I honestly never learnt as much as I did on the salon floor in the first few months! I guess my 2 and a half years of training thought me all the technicalites I needed, but nothing beats experience! I made plenty of mistakes on my first few months, but also had plenty of proud moments! I thought about leaving on numerous occasions, despite having a year left on my contract. This was mainly due to the manager at the time who was still proving to be as awkward as possible with me and really made my first few months of styling alot more difficult than they should have been. In a way I look back now and think why did I put up with such a bully, but these things happen!
      January came around and so did a new manager! I was honestly so thrilled for a fresh start and honestly to this day, is so good to our team and so supportive!
    </p>

      <h2> Rapture Extensionist</h2>
     <p> I completed my Rapture Hair Extension Training early 2019, which I was delighted to finally finish as I had began it the late summer of 2018 and the final part had been delayed!
     </p>

     <h2> My confidence soared</h2>
     <p>
      A year into being a fully qualifed stylist, my confidence had really grown. I could see a steady clientelle building up for myself, I was much quicker to get through my work. I also got a much needed pay rise which really made me feel valued as an employee, as I had still been on my trainee contract which was not up until November 2019, I was still being paid as a trainee which was not feasible in a city like Galway, with rent prices on the rise! so quite frankly, the rise in my pay was very much welcomed
    </p>
    <h2> Fast forward to January 2020</h2>
    <p>
      I was offered a place in the entrance exam for the L'Oreal Colour Specialist Degree! I was absolutly thrilled to hsve been considered for this as this was one of my main goals after qualifying and I also was very passionate about Colour! fast forward 3 weeks after sitting the exam, i got word that I had been accepted! to say I was thrilled is an understatement! I began the course in February, which proved to be very tough with lots of theory in the first few weeks, so much that I honestly had no free time, but I was so happy to be doing it!
      Unfortuately mid March, so only 3 weeks into the 8 week course, the country got hit with Coronanvirus! Work and college was shut down, and here I am writing this, career at a standstill, trying to learn how to code!

    <h1 id='aspect'> Favourite Aspect of Hairdressing?</h1>
    <div class="underline"></div>
    <p>
      My favourite aspect of Hairdressing would have to be colour, dont get me wrong, I do enjoy the rest of my job but Colour has to be my all time fave! 
      Nothing excites me more than a good colour correction, or completely transforming someone with a custom colour, be it balyage, highlights, american tailoring you name it!
      I have entered the L'Oreal Colour Trophy a couple of times, unfortunately we did not get through, but never say never!
      Also as I had mentioned I had began my Colour Specialist Pre lockdown!
      I also love introducing clients to colour, for example really subltle babylights and balyage peices to enhances ones natural colour can be so rewarding, think of it like popping on makeup and seeing your eyes pop! 
      Your hair colour can absolutely do this too!
